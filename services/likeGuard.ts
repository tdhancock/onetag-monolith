/**

 *
 * target: services/likeGuard.ts
 *
 * Small in-flight + debounce guard for "like"-style handlers.
 *
 * Rationale: a user double-tapping the heart icon on a post/comment
 * was previously able to fire two requests before the first response
 * resolved, causing a visible flicker and occasional count drift. This
 * helper centralises the protection so every like handler can share
 * the same behaviour:
 *
 *   - While a request is in flight, additional taps are dropped.
 *   - For a short cool-down window (default 400ms) after a request
 *     settles, additional taps are also dropped. This catches the
 *     "release + immediate second tap" pattern where the first
 *     request has already resolved but the user is still mashing.
 *
 * The helper is framework-agnostic on purpose so it can be unit-tested
 * with plain Jest (no React Native renderer required) and reused by
 * both the Pressable (RN) handlers and the HTML <button> (web) handlers.
