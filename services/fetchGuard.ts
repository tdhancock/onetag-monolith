/**

 *
 * target: services/fetchGuard.ts
 *
 * Small in-flight guard for "fetch" handlers (e.g. loading comments,
 * posts, notifications, profile data).
 *
 * Rationale: React components frequently re-run their `useEffect`
 * data-loading callbacks — route param changes, remounts, focus
 * listeners, pull-to-refresh, dependency-array churn — and if the
 * underlying network call hasn't returned yet, two or more requests
 * can be in flight at the same time. The first response to come back
 * wins, which can be the stale one, leaving the UI out of sync with
 * the latest state. This is a classic "last-write-wins race condition".
 *
 * This helper centralises the protection so every fetch handler can
 * share the same behaviour:
 *
 *   - While a request is in flight, additional fetches for the same
 *     key (postId, userId, …) are dropped.
 *   - The AbortController from the in-flight request is exposed via
 *     `abort()` so callers can cancel the losing request and avoid
 *     late responses overwriting fresh data (defence in depth on top
 *     of the in-flight drop).
 *   - For a short cool-down window (default 400ms) after a request
 *     settles, additional fetches for the same key are also dropped.
 *     This catches the "fire, complete, fire again immediately" loop
 *     from rapid user interaction.
 *
 * The helper is framework-agnostic on purpose so it can be unit-tested
 * with plain Jest (no React Native renderer required) and reused by
 * every fetch handler in the app.

 * signal is left alone so any background processing is not killed
 * unexpectedly by the wrapper.

 * Returns:

 *   - `{ ran: false }` when it was dropped by the guard.
 *   - `{ ran: true, error }` when the action threw; the guard is
