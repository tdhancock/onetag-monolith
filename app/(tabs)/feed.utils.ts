//
// Pure logic extracted from app/(tabs)/index.tsx (the HomeFeedScreen /
// FeedScreen component) so the data-transformation rules — appending
// unique posts to the timeline, de-duplicating stories, mapping raw
// suggestion rows to display-ready SimpleUser objects, and grouping
// stories by author — can be exercised in tests without spinning up
// React Native, expo-router, or the AppContext provider.
//
// Keeping these helpers in a sidecar file mirrors the convention used
// by SettingsScreen, LoginScreen, and ProfileScreen — it lets the
// test suite lock down the behaviour the UI relies on, and gives the
// component a single, shared source of truth.

// 1. Post timeline de-duplication
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  // full Post type and easy to test.

 * Appends a batch of incoming posts to the current list, skipping any
 * post whose `id` is already present in the current list. Returns the
 * original `current` reference unchanged when:
 *
 *   - `incoming` is empty
 *   - every incoming post is already present
 *
 * Returning the same reference (rather than a new array with the same
 * contents) lets React bail out of re-renders when there is no actual
 * change, which is what the component's original `appendUniquePosts`
 * helper does. The test pins both behaviours.

 */

 *
 * The component additionally:
 *   1. filters out blocked users via `isUserBlocked(story.username)`
 *   2. filters out the viewer's own stories when `currentUsername` is
 *      truthy
 *
 * Both filters are applied by the caller — this helper is purely about
 * the grouping step — so the test can pin the grouping behaviour
 * without having to mock the AppContext's `isUserBlocked` closure.

 * which keeps this helper free of AppContext dependencies.

// 4. Realtime-feed reducer helpers
//
// The HomeFeedScreen subscribes to Postgres Changes on the `posts` table
// and pipes every event through `handlePostUpdates`. That reducer has
// three branches, each of which mutates the local `posts` state:
//
//   - INSERT  → prepend the new post (skipping duplicates / blocked authors)
//   - UPDATE  → replace the matching post by id (e.g. reaction count change)
//   - DELETE  → drop the matching post by id
//
// We extract the pure state-transition bits here so the behaviour the
// user actually sees — "a new post shows up at the top of my feed",
// "a post disappears when its author deletes it", "the heart count
// ticks up the moment someone likes the post" — can be locked down
// with deterministic tests that do not need React, expo-router, or a
// mock Supabase channel.
//
// The helpers are intentionally framework-agnostic. They take the
// current post list and an incoming Post (or just an id) and return a
// new list, never mutating the input.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Apply a Postgres Changes INSERT payload to the timeline.
 *
 * - Returns the original `current` reference (no re-render needed) when
 *   the post is already present.
 * - Returns the original `current` reference when the post comes from
 *   a blocked author (the screen filters these out before rendering).
 * - Otherwise returns a new array with the post prepended so it shows
 *   up at the top of the feed.

 *
 * When a user likes / unlikes a post Supabase emits an UPDATE on the
 * `posts` row carrying the refreshed `likes` (reaction) count. We
 * replace the matching post in-place by id and leave every other post
 * untouched, so the rest of the timeline does not flicker.
 *
 * Returns the original `current` reference when no post matches the
 * incoming id (the post may have been deleted out from under us, or
 * the UPDATE may not yet be relevant to this screen).

 * reference so React can bail out of the re-render.

// 5. Feed-page-size / pagination helpers
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Whether the timeline should fetch another page when the user
 * reaches the end of the current list. The component sets
 * `hasMore = filteredPosts.length >= FEED_PAGE_SIZE` after every

 * `hasMore` is false. We expose the same predicate so the test can
 * pin down the "do we have a full page?" rule.
 *
 * `pageSize` is the API-defined page size; we accept it as a
 * parameter so the test can drive boundary conditions without
 * having to depend on the literal `FEED_PAGE_SIZE` constant.
