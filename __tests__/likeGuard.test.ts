/**

 *
 * Tests for the `createLikeGuard` helper added to services/likeGuard.ts.
 *
 * The bug being fixed: a rapid double-tap on the heart button was firing
 * two `toggleCommentLike` / `togglePostLike` requests before the first
 * response resolved, causing a visible flicker and occasional count drift.
 * The guard now drops taps while a request is in flight and during a
 * short cool-down window after the request settles.
