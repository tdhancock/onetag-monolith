# OneTag 🔵 

A modern, open-source social media mobile application built with React Native and Expo.

## About

OneTag is a social media app with feeds, stories, profiles and messaging, backed by Supabase.

## Features

- Authentication — Sign up, login, forgot password (Supabase Auth)
- Home Feed — Infinite scrolling feed with stories and posts
- Search — Discover users and content
- Camera — Built-in camera for capturing photos/videos
- Compose — Create new posts with media attachments
- Comments — Threaded comment system
- Direct Messages — Real-time messaging with Supabase Realtime
- Push Notifications — Expo push notifications
- User Profiles — View and edit profiles, follow/unfollow
- Stories — Create and view ephemeral stories
- Dark Theme — Full dark mode UI

- ## 🛡️ Performance & Privacy Core

- Aggressive Caching & Minimal Fetching: Built following "Lean" development principles to ensure data efficiency and minimal battery drain.
- Image & Media Compression: Advanced image optimization before network uploads to adapt to varying global internet speeds.
- Database-Level Security: Secure access managed via strict Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
- Future-Proof Roadmap: Planning for decentralized networking and integration with open communication standards like the ActivityPub protocol (Fediverse ecosystem).
- 

## Tech Stack

- React Native + Expo SDK 54
- Expo Router — File-based navigation
- NativeWind — Tailwind CSS for React Native
- Supabase — Auth, Database, Storage, Realtime
- TypeScript — Type-safe codebase.

## Architecture

- Expo Router provides file-based navigation via the app/ directory. Each folder maps to a route segment, with layout files (`_layout.tsx`) controlling navigation containers.
- Supabase handles the entire backend: Auth for user sessions, Database (PostgreSQL) for data, Storage for media uploads, and Realtime for live messaging/notifications.
- NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native) is used throughout for styling — all component classes follow Tailwind conventions.
- Server data — the auth session, profiles, the feed, messages, everything read from Supabase — lives in TanStack Query, one folder per domain under `features/`.
- AppContext (`store/AppContext.native.tsx`) holds only UI state no server owns: theme, toasts, the tooltip, and which stories this device has seen.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator (or physical device with Expo Go)

### Installation
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/onetag-monolith.git
cd onetag-monolith

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials
```

### Environment Variables

All environment variables use the `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix, which Expo exposes to client-side code at build time. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your values:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL | Yes |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anonymous/public key | Yes |

> Note: `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is a public key designed for client-side use. It is protected by Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies — it does not grant admin access. Never commit your Supabase service role key or `.env.local`.

### Running
```
# Start the development server
npx expo start

# Run on iOS
npx expo start --ios

# Run on Android
npx expo start --android
```

### Building for Production
```
# Build with EAS
eas build --platform ios
eas build --platform android
```

## Security

- Supabase anon key (`EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) is a client-side key that is designed to be public. It is protected by Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the database side — it cannot bypass RLS or access admin operations.
- Never commit `.env.local` or any file containing service role keys, secrets, or private credentials. `.env.local` is gitignored by default.
- If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/<your-username>/onetag-monolith/issues) or see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure details.
